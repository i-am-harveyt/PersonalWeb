          A couple weeks ago, an idea comes to my mind, which is build
          a website on my own. However, I was focusing on solving LeetCode problems
          and try to build a simple game to training my knowledge toward data structures
          , algorithm, familiarity toward rendering process managing and the manipulation of 
          the gaming progress. After a couple days, I've stopped building the game after I create one 
          that is able to play... having a single stage and can play smoothly without error. Since then, 
          I can pull more effort to learing React, CSS and HTML. Spending couple days learing and practicing, 
          this page is build... my first work... a personal website using React!
